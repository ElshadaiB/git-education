GIT and GitHub

What is GIT?
Git is a version control system that allows us to manage our files securely and efficiently.

Why should we learn GIT?

    The reason is straightforward and obvious. While using your browser at some point,  you will 
need to see some of your history to back up the site. When working with teams or on your own 
without Git, you must create a copy of the same file so that you can make changes and upload 
it again. While repeating these steps, you'll need a lot of storage space. However, a few 
documents were altered. At this point, you should use this Git tool to easily see your history, 
update it, and commit new ones. The key reasons for utilizing the Git technology are history and 
collaboration. One of the nicest and most popular features of Git is the ability to build feature 
branches.

What is the main purpose of creating feature branches?

    When working in a group or on your own, members of the same group should not contribute their 
code to the master or main branch without first asking or recognizing the other members. However, 
it will be easier if everyone places their code in a feature branch so that there is a member or 
team that examines the functionality of the new code and makes any necessary modifications. 
When he and the team members are satisfied with the code, they can add it to the master.
GitHub, like Git, will make all changes available to us. These two tools are necessary for both 
team and individual work.
