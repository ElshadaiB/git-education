Get helps us manage our project.

1. History - Git helps us to track change we do not need to remember the code we changed in the past Git just saves it and we can find the date and the code and what we changed later.

2. Collaboration - this is a more productive way to work with the team.

3. Feature branch - if we have a project with multiple features we do not need to wait for one feature to be completed in order for us to continue with our future it is easy to work on multiple features at once.
