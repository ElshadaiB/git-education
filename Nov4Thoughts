Clone a repo
Delete the repo, why not!

Fork a repo on Github 
Git clone (get a local copy of forked repo)
Git init -- initializing empty repo

.gitignore

Git status - check status of repo 
Git add - to track and stage changes 
Git commit - to make changes 
Git log - to show commit history 
 
My thoughts
    -The session really helped me understand Git more and use it how it is supposed to be used.
