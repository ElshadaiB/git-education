Add your notes on Sep 9 session.  

Our sep9 git learning session was very important for me as it has made the idea of why to use git and the features and advantages of using git clear for me although after the class i was not not able to use git right away because the commands were a little hard to grasp at first encounter i was able to learn them very quickly by researching online because the class cleared the idea of what the fundamentals of git were.
