Add your notes on Sep 9 session.  

It was Very good and clear EXplanation

There was a little bit confusion during our git class since we didnt have much time due to connection.

Overall it was not Excellent but also not bad Learning we got on our last session

I really like that we learn using the slides. It makes it much more easy to communicate and the slides are very friendly which helps to interact more at the same time enjoy the session.
