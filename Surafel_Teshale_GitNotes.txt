From the video i noticed it raised 3 questions, What is git, Why should we learn it, where we begin.
Git is a version control system that keeps track of our changes and makes collabration easy with other
developers. It is very efficient and effective way of managing your project along side other developers,
that's why learning git is becoming a mandatory thing in the world of software engineering.
